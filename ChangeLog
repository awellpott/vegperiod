ChangeLog for package vegperiod

changes in version 0.2.4 (2017-09-19)
fixed:
  - vegperiod() checks if Tavg (daily mean temperature) is between
    -25 and 35 to catch temperatures multiplied by 10. Sometimes done to store
    as integers. (thanks to Ronald Bialozyt for reporting a crash)

changes in version 0.2.3 (2017-08-24)
fixed:
  - vegperiod() reports end of vegetation period always as integer
added:
  - new parameter 'quiet' to readDWDdata() to suppress messages and progessbar
    of download
  - started unit testing with package 'testthat'

changes in version 0.2.2 (2016-02-18)
fixed:
  - est.prev can now be equal to number of provided years
  - proper error message if only one year of data provided and previous year's
    chill days requested
added:
  - start.method='Ribes uva-crispa' using leaf out of gooseberry as indicator.
    Developed by the Germany's National Meteorological Service (DWD).

changes in version 0.2.1 (2015-06-10)
fixed:
  - cleaned up mangled output of start.method='StdMeteo'. StdMeteo now behaves
    properly and returns a vector.
changed:
  - use stats::filter() in the package to protected filter() against getting
    run over by package dplyr (thanks to Cristabel Duran for reporting)

changes in version 0.2.0 (2015-05-30)
fixed:
  - fixed bug leading to crash of vegperiod() if argument "first.avg=0" (thanks
    to Ronald Bialozyt for reporting)
  - added a hack to method "LWF-BROOK90" in vegperiod() to adjust for
    different arithmetic precision in VBA (thanks to Paul Schmidt-Walter for
    providing climate.in files for comparison and help finding the bug)
  - fixed problems in method "StdClimatolgy" in vegperiod() (now
    renamed to "StdMeteo")
changed:
  - renamed arguments in vegperiod() to clarify meaning / easier tab
    completion:
      first.avg -> est.prev,
      temp.sum -> Tsum.out,
      method.start -> start.method,
      method.end -> end.method
  - renamed method "StdClimatolgy" to "StdMeteo" / "ETCCDI" in vegperiod()
    and brought calculations into compliance with ETCCDI standard
  - the argument "dates" of vegperiod() accepts now also character
    strings understood by as.Date()
  - rewrote help page of vegperiod() and added references for all methods
added:
  - read.DWDdata() reads open meteo data from the Climate Data Center
    of Germany's National Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD).
  - read.DWDstations() fetches information about available DWD stations

changes in version 0.1.0 (2015-04-06)
  - initial release
