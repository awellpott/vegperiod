ChangeLog for package vegperiod

changes in version 0.2.4 (2017-09-19)
fixed:
  - vegperiod() now checks if Tavg (daily mean temperature) is between -25 and 35 to catch temperatures stored as integers multiplied by 10. Thanks to Ronald Bialozyt, who reported vegperiod() crashes if fed long time series of such temperatures.

changes in version 0.2.3 (2017-08-24)
fixed:
  - end of vegetation period as reported by vegperiod() now always integer
  - DESCRIPTION now reflects new home at https://www.nw-fva.de/r-pkgs
added:
  - new parameter 'quiet' to readDWDdata to suppress messages and progessbar of download
  - started unit testing with package 'testthat'

changes in version 0.2.2 (2016-02-18)
fixed:
  - est.prev can now be equal to number of years provided
  - proper error message if only one year of data provided and previous year's chill days reqested
added:
  - start.method='Ribes uva-crispa' using leaf out of gooseberry as indicator. Developed by the German Weather Service.

changes in version 0.2.1 (2015-06-10)
fixed:
  - cleaned up mangled output of start.method='StdMeteo'. StdMeteo now behaves properly and returns a vector.
changed:
  - use stats::filter() to protected filter() against getting run over by package dplyr

changes in version 0.2.0 (2015-05-30)
fixed:
  - fixed bug leading to crash of vegperiod if argument "first.avg=0" (thanks
    to Ronald Bialozyt for pointing it out)
  - added a hack to method "LWF-BROOK90" in function vegperiod to adjust for
    different arithmetic precision in VBA (thanks to Paul Schmidt-Walter for
    providing climate.in files for comparison and help finding the bug)
  - fixed problems in method "StdClimatolgy" in function vegperiod (now
    renamed to "StdMeteo")
changed:
  - renamed arguments in function vegperiod to clarify meaning / easier tab
    completion:
    first.avg -> est.prev,
    temp.sum -> Tsum.out,
    method.start -> start.method,
    method.end -> end.method
  - renamed method "StdClimatolgy" to "StdMeteo" resp. "ETCCDI" in function
    vegperiod and rebased implementation on international standard
  - the argument "dates" of function vegperiod accepts now also character
    strings understood by as.Date()
  - rewrote help page of vegperiod and added references for all methods
added:
  - read.DWDdata() reads meteo data from the freely accessable stations of
    the Climate Data Center of the German Weather Service (Deutscher
    Wetterdienst, DWD).
  - read.DWDstations() fetches information about available DWD stations

changes in version 0.1.0 (2015-04-06)
